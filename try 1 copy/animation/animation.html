             calls love an art, and just like being good at any  art such as playing an instrument, dancing, painting,
it requires constant practice, dedication, and faith. Just as how you can't be a good piano player by  
only playing when you feel like it, you can't be  good at love if you only choose to love when it is
convenient and enjoyable for you. From also says  that an art requires faith. When you practice an
art, and you run into a difficult skill rather than  give up because it's hard. You have to have faith  
in eventually succeeding and dedicate effort  to that art until you succeed. The same is with
love. I'll get more into this later on with the  overuse of the term "red flags" but i feel like 
people start to doubt their whole relationship  just because they saw one random person on TikTok
say something. Of course, if there's constant  cheating, lying, abuse, etc. These are clear signs  
to leave. Wiring our brains to think about love as  something active rather than passive is actually  
really helpful in separating love from abuse  and dishonesty.To  begin by always thinking of love as an action  
rather than a feeling is one way in which anyone using the word in this manner, automatically
assumes accountability and responsibility. We  are often taught we have no control over our
feelings, yet most of us accept that we choose our  actions. That intention and will inform what we do.
We also accept that our actions have consequences. To think of actions shaping feelings is one way  
we rid ourselves of conventionally accepted  assumptions, such as that one simply falls in
love without exercising will or choice, that  there are such things as "crimes of passion"
I think that most importantly when you work on an  art, creating a wonderful result is what leaves you  
with fulfillment, right? For instance, by finishing  a beautiful painting, an artist bestows meaning
upon their life because the painting, as a product  of the artist's efforts, reflects their incredible  
abilities back onto themselves. The artist realizes  that they are the reason why this canvas is so  
beautiful. Thus, love is to nurture the flourishing  of someone else and you recognize your own worth  
through their flourishing. If we treat love as  an active art rather than a thing, love is about  
giving rather than receiving. A lot of people think  that giving equals sacrifice and that's why it's  
so honorable to do it. But Fromm says that giving does not have to require us sacrificing anything .
When done for the sake of giving, and not some  other goal, giving is actually the best way  
to combat our existential loneliness. When  you give you experience your own strength,  
energy, and aliveness. This is true when you  give anything such as giving money or giving
food to your children. But this is especially  true in giving love because when you give 
love, you give all the things that make up you. Your interests, your emotions, your passions your  
knowledge. And giving love is not about  giving material objects, it's about giving you as
a person. Sharing your thoughts, your humor, your  joy, and your sadness. That's what giving love is.
